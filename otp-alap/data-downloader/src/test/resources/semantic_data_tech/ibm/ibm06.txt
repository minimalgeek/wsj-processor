IBM acquired PwC's consulting business (2002), SPSS (2009) and Kenexa (2012), also spinning off companies like printer manufacturer Lexmark (1991), and selling off to Lenovo its personal computer product line (2005), plus its x86-based server businesses (2014). Also in 2014, IBM announced that it would go "fabless" by offloading IBM Micro Electronics semiconductor manufacturing to GlobalFoundries, a leader in advanced technology manufacturing, citing that semiconductor manufacturing is a capital-intensive business which is challenging to operate without scale. This transition had progressed as of early 2015.
